# Annotation for KSCGR

## Classes Annotation

When considering the annotation of classes of objects, we differentiate eggs in several classes according to their recipe. We consider the following classes for eggs:

```
shell egg
boiled egg
hard-boiled egg
broken egg
mixed egg
baked egg
ham egg
kinshi egg
scrambled egg
omelette
```

We consider the annotation for each of these classes as following:

### Shell egg

This is the raw egg that usually appears in the beginning of each video. Sometimes it is broken into the bowl or frying pan, others it is boiled in pan.

### Boiled egg

An egg is considered boiled only after the hot water is removed from the pan or the egg is removed from the pan (with water). Before the water is removed, the egg is still considered as a shell egg.

### Hard-boiled egg

An egg is considered as hard-boiled egg when its egg white appears. Before it appears, the egg is considered as boiled egg.

### Broken egg

An egg is broken when it shows its raw yolk.

### Mixed egg

A beaten egg is named after the first moves of the hashi in the broken egg.

### Baked egg

The baked egg occurs after the egg is put inside the frying pan.

### Ham egg

A ham egg can be identified when an egg is mixed with ham inside the frying pan.

### Kinshi egg

Kinshi egg is the baked egg that is cut in pieces. It becomes kinshi egg after joining all pieces together on the plate.

### Omelette

An egg is considered as omelette in the moment the baked egg is placed onto the plate.

### Scrambled egg

An egg is considered as scrambled egg in the moment the baked egg is placed onto the plate.
